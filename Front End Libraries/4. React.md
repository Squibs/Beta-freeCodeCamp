## Introduction to the React Challenges

Challenges are in an alpha stage at this point. I will be doing these challenges at http://hysterical-amusement.surge.sh/.

React is an Open Source view library created and maintained by Facebook. It's a great tool to render the User interface (UI) of modern web applications.

React uses a syntax extension of JavaScript called JSX that allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript. This has several benefits; it lets you use the full programmatic power of JavaScript within HTML, and helps to keep your code readable. JSX is mostly similar to the HTML you have already learned, however there are a few key differences that will be covered in these challenges.
